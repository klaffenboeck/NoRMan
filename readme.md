# NoRMan (Notion Reference Manager)

NoRMan is a desktop application designed for managing academic references stored in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). Originally built to streamline my own workflow, it is currently tailored to my specific use case and may not yet be broadly applicable to others. However, I recognize its potential value beyond my personal needs and plan to continue its development to make it more flexible and generally useful.

## Features

- **BibTeX Parsing**: Import references from BibTeX files into your Notion database.
- **Notion Synchronization**: Load and manage references from Notion within NoRMan.
- **Citation Formatting**: Generate in-text citations and bibliographies in multiple formats:
  - **HTML**
  - **LaTeX**
  - **Markdown**
  - **RichText (RTF, Word, etc.)**
- **Customizable Styles**: Define and modify citation styles using configurable templates.

## Installation

*Installation instructions will be provided as development progresses.*

## Usage

1. **Sync with Notion**: Connect NoRMan to your Notion database to push or retrieve references.
2. **Generate Citations**: Format references for use in HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, or RichText documents.
3. **BibTeX Parsing**: Extract and structure reference fields for searchability.
4. **Generate Consistent IDs**: Ensure uniform citation keys for your BibTeX files.

*Detailed instructions and examples will be added soon.*

## Development Status

NoRMan is in **early development**, and its functionality is still evolving. As of now, it is highly customized for my own needs and may not yet be suitable for general use. Over time, I aim to refine its features and improve its adaptability.
