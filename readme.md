# NoRMan (Notion Reference Manager)

NoRMan is a desktop application designed for managing academic references stored in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). It provides a streamlined interface for parsing BibTeX references, pushing them into a Notion database, and retrieving them for citation formatting in various styles.

## Features

- **BibTeX Parsing**: Import references from BibTeX files into your Notion database.
- **Notion Synchronization**: Load and manage references from Notion in NoRMan.
- **Citation Formatting**: Generate in-text citations and bibliographies in multiple formats:
  - **HTML**
  - **LaTeX**
  - **Mardkown**
- **Customizable Styles**: Define and modify citation styles using configurable templates.

## Configuration

NoRMan relies on JSON-based configuration files to manage settings:

- **config.json**: Stores paths, project options, and predefined citation settings.
- **notion_config.json**: Contains authentication details for connecting to Notion.
- **formatting_styles.json**: Defines formatting rules for author lists, journal references, and in-text citations.
